Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and 
insights from structured and unstructured data. It is a continuation of data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and 
predictive analytics. The increasing availability of data has made this field one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing areas in 
technology and research.
